Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`\nfile.\n\n    dependencies:\n      mock: any\n\nThen run `pub install`.\n\nFor more information, see the\n[mock package on pub.dartlang.org](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/mock).\n\n## Using ##\n\nTo create a mock objects for some class T, create a new class using:\n\n    class MockT extends Mock implements T {};\n\nThen specify the [Behavior] of the Mock for different methods using\n[when] (to select the method and parameters) and then the [Action]s\nfor the [Behavior] by calling [thenReturn], [alwaysReturn], [thenThrow],\n[alwaysThrow], [thenCall] or [alwaysCall].\n\n[thenReturn], [thenThrow] and [thenCall] are one-shot so you would\ntypically call these more than once to specify a sequence of actions;\nthis can be done with chained calls, e.g.:\n\n     m.when(callsTo('foo')).\n         thenReturn(0).thenReturn(1).thenReturn(2);\n\n[thenCall] and [alwaysCall] allow you to proxy mocked methods, chaining\nto some other implementation. This provides a way to implement 'spies'.\n\nFor getters and setters, use \"get foo\" and \"set foo\"-style arguments\nto [callsTo].\n\nYou can disable logging for a particular [Behavior] easily:\n\n    m.when(callsTo('bar')).logging = false;\n\nYou can then use the mock object. Once you are done, to verify the\nbehavior, use [getLogs] to extract a relevant subset of method call\nlogs and apply [Matchers] to these through calling [verify].\n\nA Mock can be given a name when constructed. In this case instead of\nkeeping its own log, it uses a shared log. This can be useful to get an\naudit trail of interleaved behavior. It is the responsibility of the user\nto ensure that mock names, if used, are unique.\n\nLimitations:\n\n* only positional parameters are supported (up to 10);\n* to mock getters you will need to include parentheses in the call\n      (e.g. m.length() will work but not m.length).\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n    class MockList extends Mock implements List {};\n\n    List m = new MockList();\n    m.when(callsTo('add', anything)).alwaysReturn(0);\n\n    m.add('foo');\n    m.add('bar');\n\n    getLogs(m, callsTo('add', anything)).verify(happenedExactly(2));\n    getLogs(m, callsTo('add', 'foo')).verify(happenedOnce);\n    getLogs(m, callsTo('add', 'isNull)).verify(neverHappened);\n\nNote that we don't need to provide argument matchers for all arguments,\nbut we do need to provide arguments for all matchers. So this is allowed:\n\n    m.when(callsTo('add')).alwaysReturn(0);\n    m.add(1, 2);\n\nBut this is not allowed and will throw an exception:\n\n    m.when(callsTo('add', anything, anything)).alwaysReturn(0);\n    m.add(1);\n\nHere is a way to implement a 'spy', which is where we log the call\nbut then hand it off to some other function, which is the same\nmethod in a real instance of the class being mocked:\n\n    class Foo {\n      bar(a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n    }\n\n    class MockFoo extends Mock implements Foo {\n      Foo real;\n      MockFoo() {\n        real = new Foo();\n        this.when(callsTo('bar')).alwaysCall(real.bar);\n      }\n    }\n\n[pub]: http://pub.dartlang.org\n","uri":"package:unittest/mock.dart","name":"package:unittest/mock.dart","id":"mock","children":[{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[neverThrew] asserts that no matching call to a method threw\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"neverThrew","id":"neverThrew1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1228","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[sometimeThrew] asserts that at least one matching call to a method threw\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"sometimeThrew","id":"sometimeThrew1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1221","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[alwaysThrew] asserts that all matching calls to a method threw\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"alwaysThrew","id":"alwaysThrew1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1214","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[neverReturned] asserts that no matching calls to a method returned\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"neverReturned","id":"neverReturned1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1207","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[sometimeReturned] asserts that at least one matching call to a method\nreturned a value that matched [value].\n","name":"sometimeReturned","id":"sometimeReturned1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1200","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[alwaysReturned] asserts that all matching calls to a method returned\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"alwaysReturned","id":"alwaysReturned1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1193","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[throwing] matches log entrues where the call to a method threw\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"throwing","id":"throwing1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1088","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"\n[returning] matches log entries where the call to a method returned\na value that matched [value].\n","name":"returning","id":"returning1()","children":[{"name":"value","id":"value","kind":"param"}],"line":"1081","kind":"method"},{"returnType":{"refId":"matcher/Matcher","name":"Matcher"},"comment":"[happenedAtMost] matches a maximum number of calls.
