See the [Getting Started](http://pub.dartlang.org/doc)\nguide for more details.\n\n##Concepts##\n\n * __Tests__: Tests are specified via the top-level function [test], they can be\n   organized together using [group].\n * __Checks__: Test expectations can be specified via [expect]\n * __Matchers__: [expect] assertions are written declaratively using the\n   [Matcher] class.\n * __Configuration__: The framework can be adapted by calling [configure] with a\n   [Configuration]. See the other libraries in the `unittest` package for\n   alternative implementations of [Configuration] including\n   `compact_vm_config.dart`, `html_config.dart` and\n   `html_enhanced_config.dart`.\n\n##Examples##\n\nA trivial test:\n\n    import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';\n    main() {\n      test('this is a test', () {\n        int x = 2 + 3;\n        expect(x, equals(5));\n      });\n    }\n\nMultiple tests:\n\n    import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';\n    main() {\n      test('this is a test', () {\n        int x = 2 + 3;\n        expect(x, equals(5));\n      });\n      test('this is another test', () {\n        int x = 2 + 3;\n        expect(x, equals(5));\n      });\n    }\n\nMultiple tests, grouped by category:\n\n    import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';\n    main() {\n      group('group A', () {\n        test('test A.1', () {\n          int x = 2 + 3;\n          expect(x, equals(5));\n        });\n        test('test A.2', () {\n          int x = 2 + 3;\n          expect(x, equals(5));\n        });\n      });\n      group('group B', () {\n        test('this B.1', () {\n          int x = 2 + 3;\n          expect(x, equals(5));\n        });\n      });\n    }\n\nAsynchronous tests: if callbacks expect between 0 and 2 positional arguments,\ndepending on the suffix of expectAsyncX(). expectAsyncX() will wrap a\nfunction into a new callback and will not consider the test complete until\nthat callback is run. A count argument can be provided to specify the number\nof times the callback should be called (the default is 1).\n\n    import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';\n    import 'dart:isolate';\n    main() {\n      test('callback is executed once', () {\n        // wrap the callback of an asynchronous call with [expectAsync0] if\n        // the callback takes 0 arguments...\n        var timer = Timer.run(expectAsync0(() {\n          int x = 2 + 3;\n          expect(x, equals(5));\n        }));\n      });\n\n      test('callback is executed twice', () {\n        var callback = expectAsync0(() {\n          int x = 2 + 3;\n          expect(x, equals(5));\n        }, count: 2); // <-- we can indicate multiplicity to [expectAsync0]\n        Timer.run(callback);\n        Timer.run(callback);\n      });\n    }\n\nexpectAsyncX() will wrap the callback code in a try/catch handler to handle\nexceptions (treated as test failures). There may be times when the number of\ntimes a callback should be called is non-deterministic. In this case a dummy\ncallback can be created with expectAsync0((){}) and this can be called from\nthe real callback when it is finally complete. In this case the body of the\ncallback should be protected within a call to guardAsync(); this will ensure\nthat exceptions are properly handled.\n\nA variation on this is expectAsyncUntilX(), which takes a callback as the\nfirst parameter and a predicate function as the second parameter; after each\ntime * the callback is called, the predicate function will be called; if it\nreturns false the test will still be considered incomplete.\n\nTest functions can return [Future]s, which provide another way of doing\nasynchronous tests. The test framework will handle exceptions thrown by\nthe Future, and will advance to the next test when the Future is complete.\nIt is still important to use expectAsync/guardAsync with any parts of the\ntest that may be invoked from a top level context (for example, with\nTimer.run()], as the Future exception handler may not capture exceptions\nin such code.\n\nNote: due to some language limitations we have to use different functions\ndepending on the number of positional arguments of the callback. In the\nfuture, we plan to expose a single `expectAsync` function that can be used\nregardless of the number of positional arguments. This requires new langauge\nfeatures or fixes to the current spec (e.g. see\n[Issue 2706](http://dartbug.com/2706)).\n\nMeanwhile, we plan to add this alternative API for callbacks of more than 2\narguments or that take named parameters. (this is not implemented yet,\nbut will be coming here soon).\n\n    import 'package:unittest/unittest.dart';\n    import 'dart:isolate';\n    main() {\n      test('callback is executed', () {\n        // indicate ahead of time that an async callback is expected.\n        var async = startAsync();\n        Timer.run(() {\n          // Guard the body of the callback, so errors are propagated\n          // correctly.\n          guardAsync(() {\n            int x = 2 + 3;\n            expect(x, equals(5));\n          });\n          // indicate that the asynchronous callback was invoked.\n          async.complete();\n        });\n      });\n    }\n\n","line":"154"}
